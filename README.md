# JavaServer Faces with Spring Boot
This is a showcase app based on [spring-boot-faces](https://github.com/auth0-blog/spring-boot-faces) 
and aimes to show migration needs when advancing JDK and Springboot versions.

The various variants are kept in separate branches to show the differences on dependencies and code when necessary.
I started the exercises based on openjdk 1.8, advancing to openjdk 11 with goal to get it running with openjdk 17 and 21 as well.

## springboot_1.5.2_myfaces_primefaces (openjdk 1.8)
## springboot_2.7_myfaces_primefaces (openjdk 1.8)
## springboot_2.7_myfaces_primefaces_jdk11 (openjdk 11)
- had to delegate IntelliJ build to mvn - or maybe use Intellij version later then 2021.1?
